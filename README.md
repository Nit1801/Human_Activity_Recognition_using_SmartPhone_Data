# Human_Activity_Recognition_using_SmartPhone_Data
This project analyzes data from 30 volunteers performing six everyday activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING). The data was collected using a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at a rate of 50 readings per second. The data was cleaned and processed by filtering out noise, dividing it into overlapping 2.56-second segments, and extracting useful features. The bodyâ€™s motion and gravity components were separated using a specialized filter. To better understand the data, we analyzed key features and used techniques like PCA and t-SNE to simplify and visualize it. Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were trained and optimized to classify the activities. This project requires Python and some commonly used libraries. To try it yourself, download the files, set up the required tools, and follow the steps in the provided notebook to explore the data and test the models.
